== BeagleBone AI-64 Overview

BeagleBone AI-64 is the latest addition to BeagleBoard.org
family and like its predecessors, is designed to address the Open Source
Community, early adopters, and anyone interested in a low cost ARM
Cortex-A8 processor based Single Board Computer (SBC).

It has been equipped with a minimum set of features to allow the user to
experience the power of the processor and is not intended as a full
development platform as many of the features and interfaces supplied by
the processor are not accessible from BeagleBone AI-64 via onboard
support of some interfaces. It is not a complete product designed to do
any particular function. It is a foundation for experimentation and
learning how to program the processor and to access the peripherals by
the creation of your own software and hardware.

It also offers access to many of the interfaces and allows for the use
of add-on boards called capes, to add many different combinations of
features. A user may also develop their own board or add their own
circuitry.

BeagleBone AI-64 is manufactured and warranted by partners listed at
https://beagleboard.org/logo for the benefit of the community and its
supporters including the current BeagleBoard.org Foundation board members

Jason Kridner, principal of JK Embedded Consulting an 
independent contractor and architect for new Beagle designs.

Robert Nelson, applications engineer at Digi-Key
Mark Yoder, professor at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology

The BBAI-64 board is designed designed 
by Seeed Studio (Seeed Development Limited) 
under guidance from BeagleBoard.org Foundation.

[[beaglebone-compatibility]]
=== BeagleBone Compatibility
#TODO:#
The board is intended to be compatible with the original BeagleBone as
much as possible. There are several areas where there are differences
between the two designs. These differences are listed below, along with
the reasons for the differences.

* J721E DRA829/TDA4VM/AM752x, 2GHZ, 64 Bit, processor.
** Sorry, we just had to make it WAY faster.
* 4GB LPDDR4
** _Cost reduction ???_
** Performance boost!!!
** Memory size increase
** Lower power
* Debug TTL serial.
** _Cost reduction_
** Can be added by buying a TTL to USB Cable that is widely available
** Single largest cost reduction action taken
* EEPROM Reduced from 4KB to 1KB
** _Cost Reduction_
* Onboard Managed NAND (eMMC)
** 16GB
** _Cost reduction_
** Performance boost x8 vs. x4 bits
** Performance boost due to deterministic properties vs. microSD card
* GPMC bus may not be accessible from the expansion headers in some
cases
** Result of eMMC on the main board
** Signals are still routed to the expansion connector
** If eMMC is not used, signals can be used via expansion if eMMC is
held in reset
* There may be 10 less GPIO pins available
** Result of eMMC
** If eMMC is not used, could still be used
* The power expansion header, for battery and back-light, has been
removed
** __Cost reduction,__space reduction
** Four pins were added to provide access to the battery charger
function.
* Display Port interface onboard
** Feature addition
** Audio and video capable
** Micro DP
* No three function USB cable
** _Cost reduction_
* GPIO3_21 has a 24.576 MHZ clock on it.
** This is required by the display Framer for Audio purposes. We needed to
run a clock into the processor to generate the correct clock frequency.
The pin on the processor was already routed to the expansion header. In
order not to remove this feature on the expansion header, it was left
connected. In order to use the pin as a GPIO pin, you need to disable
the clock. While this disables audio to the display, the fact that you want
to use this pin for something else, does the same thing.
