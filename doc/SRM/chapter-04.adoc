== BeagleBone AI-64 Overview

BeagleBone AI-64 is the latest addition to BeagleBoard.org
family and like its predecessors, is designed to address the open-source
Community, early adopters, and anyone interested in a low cost
64-bit Dual Arm® Cortex®-A72 processor based Single Board Computer (SBC).

It has been equipped with a minimum set of features to allow the user to
experience the power of the processor and is not intended as a full
development platform as many of the features and interfaces supplied by
the processor are not accessible from BeagleBone AI-64 via onboard
support of some interfaces. It is not a complete product designed to do
any particular function. It is a foundation for experimentation and
learning how to program the processor and to access the peripherals by
the creation of your own software and hardware.

It also offers access to many of the interfaces and allows for the use
of add-on boards called capes, to add many different combinations of
features. A user may also develop their own board or add their own
circuitry.

BeagleBone AI-64 is manufactured and warranted by partners listed at
https://beagleboard.org/logo for the benefit of the community and its
supporters including the current BeagleBoard.org Foundation board members

BeagleBone AI-64 has been designed 
by Seeed Studio (Seeed Development Limited) 
under guidance from BeagleBoard.org Foundation.

[[beaglebone-compatibility]]
=== BeagleBone Compatibility
The board is intended to provide functionality well beyond BeagleBone Black or BeagleBone AI, while still providing compatibility with BeagleBone Black's expansion headers as 
much as possible. There are several significant differences between the three designs.

image::images/ch04/components.png[title="BeagleBone AI-64 board components"]

* *DC Power* is the main DC input that accepts 5V power.
* *Power Button* alerts the processor to initiate the power down
sequence and is used to power down the board.
* *GigaBit Ethernet* is the connection to the LAN.
* *Serial Debug ports* WKUP_UART0 for early boot from the management MCU 
and UART0 is for the main processor.
* *USB Client* is a USB-C connection to a PC that can also power the
board.
* *BOOT switch* can be used to force a boot from the microSD card if the
power is cycled on the board, removing power and reapplying the power to
the board..
* There are five green **LEDs** that can be used by the user.
* *Reset Button* allows the user to reset the processor.
* *microSD* slot is where a microSD card can be installed.
* *miniDP* connector is where the display is connected to.
* *USB Host* can be connected different USB interfaces such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, Keyboard, etc.

On bottom side we have,

* *TI TDA4VM* processor.
* *4GB LPDDR4* Dual Data Rate RAM memory.
