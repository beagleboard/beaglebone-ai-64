== Change History

This section describes the change history of this document and board.
Document changes are not always a result of a board change. A board
change will always result in a document change.

[[rev-B]]
==== Rev B

We are starting with revision B based on this being an update to the BeagleBone AI. However, because this board ended up being so different, we've decided to name it BeagleBone AI-64, rather than simply a new revision. This refers to the Seeed release on 21 Dec 2021 of "BeagleBone AI-64_SCH_Rev B_211221". This is the initial production release.

[[rev-B1]]
==== Rev B1

This revision was made based on design-for-manufacturing updates after the initial production pilot run. 

This refers to the Seeed release on 02 Jun 2022 of "BeagleBone AI-64_SCH_Rev B1_220602".

The changes are:

* MH4, MH5, MH6, MH7: Changed the hole diameter from 4.5MM to 4.4MM.
* R0201, C0201: Changed the distance between two pads from 0.28MM to 0.23MM.
* Type C Connector J5: Changed the diameter of location hole from 0.65MM to 0.75MM.
* Wave SoIdering: Moved D43 D44 away from J5; Moved C440 away from J7.
* PCB Revision: Added "B1" on the PCB bottom for internal record.
